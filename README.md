## Description

This application was created for our bootcamp's second project. This will showcase our acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. Our focus is to execute a design that solves a real-world problem by creating a hub for groups of people to communicate.

This project was created using agile development methodologies and implementation of feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.


User Story <br>
As a user I want to be able to share my schedule and communicate with my social group so that I can plan events around our busy schedule.
